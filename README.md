## Description

I developed a number guessing game with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap & Sass) and plain JavaScript.

This is how it works:
- When the game starts, a random number between 1 and 10 is generated;
- A player has up to three chances to guess the correct number;
- When a player makes a wrong guess, the number of remaining guesses are shown;
- When a player runs out of guesses, or wins the game, the input field will be automatically disabled;
- After each game the scoreboard will be updated.

The page doesn't reload such that the scoreboard doesn't reset.

Have fun playing!
